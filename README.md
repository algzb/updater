# Automatic updater for phpList

Provides an easy, automated, web-based update mechanism for phpList installations.

### Usage

The new phpList updater gives you an easy way to upgrade your installation via web. In just four steps you can update your installation to the latest release. 

The updater will be available in all releases starting with phpList 3.3.7-RC1 

### Requirements

The automatic updater requires the following PHP extensions: curl, zip and pdo.

### Technical details

The updater is currently performing the following steps. If one of those steps fail, you will have the possibility to correct the error and retry from the current step.

1. Check if the user is authenticated (Only superadmins can update phpList)
2. Check if there is an update available
3. Check for write permissions
4. Check whether all required phpList files are in place
5. Ask the user if they want a backup of the software:
 - Yes: ask the user for the location
 - If no: continue to the next step.
  
6. Download new version to a temporary folder
7. Add maintenance mode
8. Replace PHP entry points with "Update in progress" message
9. Delete old files except config, updater and temporary directory
10. Move new files in place
11. Move new PHP entry points in place
12. Move updater to a temporary directory
13. Delete temporary files
14. Remove maintenance mode
15. Move new updater in place
16. Deauthenticate updater session
17. Redirect to the phpList dashboard

### What the updater doesn't do (yet):

The updater is at the moment solely focused on replacing the files of the core installation. It does neither:

- Upgrade the database (this uses the existing database migration code)
- Upgrade the plugins (this uses the existing plugin updater)

### Notes

- The updater stops when it finds unexpected files (not from phpList default installation) and lists them. To continue, you should delete these files.
- Any plugins that are not included in releases are removed and need to reinstalled following update (settings for those plugins in the database are not affected; reinstalling the plugins should make them work as before).
- It is possible to override the backup checks by reloading the page when the backup check fails. Do not reload the page unless you wish to proceed without a backup in this case.
- When the update process fails you should manually remove actions.txt file inside the config folder in order to reset the process and be able to try again.

### Future development plans

At the moment only our current stable release, phpList 3, is supported by the updater. Weâ€™ll work on adding support to our upcoming phpList 4 release.
